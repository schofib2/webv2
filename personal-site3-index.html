<h1>My Life as a Runner</h1>
<h2> The Start</h2>
<p> I began watching my sister run when she was a freshman in high school and I was in 1st grade. I loved watching her compete and found it very inspiring how hard she would push herself. When I was in 3rd grade I joined my town's running club, where we would meet twice a week. I definitely wasn't considered a runner at this point, as I played a variety of sports such as:
<ul>
	<li>Tennis</li> <li>Softball</li> <li>Basketball</li> <li>Soccer</li> </ul>
 I didn't begin seriously running until high school.

<h2> High School and Beyond</h2>
<p> Freshman year of high school I joined my school's cross country team and immediately fell in love with it. I loved both the team and the competition of running. I continued with winter and spring track that year and every year of high school after that. As my senior year began and I begun to apply to college, I had to decide if I would continue my running career. I loved running, but worried it would be overwhelming. After getting accepted into TCNJ, I decide I would continue on the cross country and track team here!
